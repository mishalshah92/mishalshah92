### Hi there, I'm Mishal Shah <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="28">  
**Cloud Infrastructure • Terraform Architect • Platform Engineering • Automation Specialist**

I design and build **scalable**, **secure**, **production-grade** **cloud infrastructure** across **AWS**, **Azure** 
and other public, cloud with a core focus on **Infrastructure-as-Code**, **serverless automation**, **image pipelines**, 
and **platform-level reusable modules**.

My strength lies in creating **foundational cloud building blocks** and turning them into **high-level constructs**, 
enabling consistency, speed, and reliability across engineering teams.

🚀 **What I Work On**

**Cloud Platforms**
- AWS (EC2, EBS, Lambda, IAM, VPC, ECS, Serverless workloads)
- Azure (AKS, ACR, VNets, Subnets, NSGs, App Services, Platform Services)

**Infrastructure as Code**

- Terraform (modular design, core modules, construct repos, landing zones)
- Automated provisioning frameworks
- CI/CD-driven IaC pipelines

**Automation & Developer Experience**
- AWS Lambda schedulers
- Snapshot-based caching systems
- Build image pipelines using Packer + Ansible
- Pre-cached Docker layer systems for ultra-fast builds

**Systems Reliability**
- Zero-downtime upgrades
- Configuration standardization
- Build-time optimizations
- Environment parity across dev/stage/prod

🔧 **Tech Stack & Tools**

- Cloud Platforms: **AWS**, **GCP**, **Azure**, **OCI**
- Infrastructure as Code: **Terraform**, **Pulumi**
- Containerization & Orchestration: **Docker**, **Kubernetes**
- Monitoring & Observability: **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **ELK**
- CI/CD & Automation: **GitHub Actions**, **Jenkins**, **CircleCI**
- Scripting & Languages: **Bash**, **Python**, **Go**, **Java**

💡 **A Little About Me**

> "Mishal" means *example*, and that's what I strive to be — in tech, in mindset, and in collaboration.

- 🔍 Currently exploring chaos engineering and production-grade reliability practices
- 🌱 Learning advanced multi-cloud approches.
- ✍️ Writing about real-world infra fixes & cloud patterns

🧱 **My Engineering Philosophy**

- **Modules over scripts →** repeatable, tested, controllable
- **Constructs over handcrafted IaC →** consistency for teams
- **Automation over manual ops →** reduce friction
- **Separation of concerns →** core modules vs high-level patterns
- **Snapshots, caching, image pipelines →** faster developer workflows
- **Secure-by-default IaC →** least privilege, tagging, policy, compliance
